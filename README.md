# OS OpenRoads Data Processing

[OS Open Roads](https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/business-government/products/open-map-roads) is an Open data set provided by OS. OS Open Roads provides the geometry & spatial location of all roads within the UK. This can facilitate in answer spatial questions such as: How many miles of roads are there in the country? What and whereâ€™s within 10 miles of this location?
Unfortunately to make use of this data, you need to be able to convert it into a format you can use, for me, that is within a PostGIS database.

This project automates the creation of a PostGIS enabled Postgres database which is ready for you to populate with the Open Roads data via the `load_road_data` script.

To create you own version of the database you will need to download your own copy of OS Open Roads in the `ESRI Shape` format from [Ordance Survey](https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/opendatadownload/products.html#OPROAD) and save it into the route of this project, then run the following commands:

```
docker build -t <name>:<tag .
docker run --rm -d -p 5432:5432 -v ~/Desktop:/db_data --name <container name> <name>:<tag
```

Once you have the container running you can the `exec` into it and manually run the `load_road_data` script.
This script does the following:

1. Populates the Postgres database with the OS Open Roads data;
2. Create GIST indexes using the geom column to make spatial queries faster;
3. Vacuum Analyses each table to optimise query times;
4. Creates an export of the database in Postgres custom data format `*.dump` file;
5. Places a copy of the `dump` file on a the host machines desktop;

```
docker exec -it road_closures_db_1 bash
./load_road_data
```
